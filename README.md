Shopping Cart Project

Hey, welcome to the Shopping Cart project.

The environment we are working in is shopping-env. To create and access this virtual environment in your terminal, type:

```sh
conda create -n shopping-env python=3.7 # (first time only)
conda activate shopping-env
```

You also need to make sure you install the necessary packages to run the program. These are:

```sh
csv
datetime
os
pandas
json
dotenv
sendgrid
```

Use the "pip install" format to install these packages when you first create the virtual environment. 

Then, access the folder shopping-cart within the environment. 


My version includes email capability, so you have the option to choose whether you want both a receipt prompt and an email receipt, or just the receipt prompt. Thanks and happy shopping.
