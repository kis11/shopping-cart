Shopping Cart Project

Hey, welcome to the Shopping Cart project.

The environment we are working in is shopping-env. To create and access this virtual environment in your terminal, type:

```sh
conda create -n shopping-env python=3.7 # (first time only)
conda activate shopping-env
```

You also need to make sure you install the necessary packages to run the program. These are:

```sh
csv
datetime
os
pandas
json
dotenv
sendgrid
```

Use the "pip install" format to install these packages when you first create the virtual environment. Consult the professor's Github repository if you need extra details. 

On Github, fork the folder and clone it onto your computer.

Then, access the folder shopping-cart within the environment:

```sh
cd ~/selectedpathonyourcomputer/shopping-cart/shopping_cart.py
```

The prompt should open and you may select the identifiers chosen at the store. When you are done, make sure you type DONE in all caps. Then, your receipt will pop up. You will then have the option to also receive an email receipt. Thanks and happy shopping.
