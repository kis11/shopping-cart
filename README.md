Shopping Cart Project

Hey, welcome to the Shopping Cart project.

The environment we are working in is shopping-env. To create and access this virtual environment in your terminal, type:

```sh
conda create -n shopping-env python=3.7 # (first time only)
conda activate shopping-env
```

Then, access the folder shopping-cart. 


My version includes email capability, so you have the option to choose whether you want both a receipt prompt and email receipt or just the receipt prompt. Thanks and happy shopping.
